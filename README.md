## Motivation
- Like daily check-in and daily day-level goal completion aspects of [Status Hero](https://statushero.com/) but this tool is geared towards teams and lacks task-level tracking
- Like daily task-level goal completion of and historical goal completion views of HabitBull but this tool does not support one-off daily tasks
- Trello offers flexible task-level tracking via checklists and day-level tracking via cards. Trello has a Card Repeater power-up but lacks ability to roll over checklist items, set a title based ondate, or a due date based on date.
